# What is this !?
This is a very slow compression tool made in haskell.
No multithreading , nope nothing.
Its work in progress just check the main function in app/Main.
Thats all.
# How do I use it ?
You sadly can't for now
# How do I build it
## If you have Nix
This is just optional you can just use cabal to build
But I used this dev flake while I build it. This may help reproducibility
```
nix develop
cabal build
```
## Normal build
Just use this
```
cabal build
```
